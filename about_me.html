						<li style = "font-size: 60%"> Born in Birmingham, Alabama, my family moved to Austin, TX when I was 2 years old in anticipation of the birth of my little brother, Sina. I grew up in Austin, TX and spent summers at a summer camp in Tennessee called Camp Country Lad. I spent 1st through 12th grades at St. Andrew's Episcopal School, although my family has changed houses over 3 times within Austin. Throughout my childhood, I loved sports, with basketball being my absolute favorite. 
						</li>
						<li style = "font-size: 60%"> As I got older, specifically towards the latter half of high school, I became really interested in sustainability and politics. I became incredibly involved in local politics during my one year at Trinity University in San Antonio where I was a campus organizer for a US house race, volunteer on many different campaigns, and an executive member of the Trinity Progressives, a role that allowed me to organize an event for Bernie Sanders to come to campus. However, after a year, I realized that I wanted to explore a new scene outside of Texas, and I transferred to Duke University in Durham, NC, where I am currently a junior pursuing a B.A. in data science in the computer science and statistics departments.
